1. Buttons: Buttons are a bigger surface to click.

2. Length: Done

3. Could the option boxes display. Maybe this should be do-able with
the layout engine I'm using but I am using a pretty wide screen and 6 is kind of sane

3. Inter-code testing: Separate projects are never going to happen for this
iteration of the system. Multiple simultaneous projects requires a fundamental,
ground-up redesign. One only current solution is to host multiple independant
instances of the system.

With regards the statistics I strongly doubt slow people are an issue. As long
as the slow person has coded enough tweets then a statistical comparison
can be calculated.

4. Export: Labels in the app have no knowledge of any external numeric Coding
you might have decided. It should be trivial to convert a set of text labels in
a column to a set of numbers in  SPSS. in R this would be column as.factor()

5 RT info: have Moved this info alongside the tweet instead of over.
I can't add the other info as it is not in the tweet dataset. Do you want this
infor loaded from the candidate dataset? If yes then the input file format
will need to changes

6 Author and mentioned bios: The bios can not be displayed on this page as twitter
don't provide a method to get just the bio info in a nice format. Note that Those bio
links take you to twitter it is no handled by app

1. Conditional categories: we have added this and it looks simple from the admin, just not displaying on coding interface. One possible issue might be T6 where 1 should display T7 and 3 should display T8, though 2 should display both T7 and T8. So could we add multiple child categories?

2. Code button check: perfect :)

3. Sweet.
